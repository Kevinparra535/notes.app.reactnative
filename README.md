## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

**Note:** This project is set up with Expo, making it compatible with both Android and iOS using the [Expo GO](https://expo.dev/client) app.

Before launching the project, modify `node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js` as follows:
```javascript
// Change
import App from '../../src/App';
// To
import App from '../../App';
```

Then, run the following command to start Expo. The `-c` flag in `package.json` ensures npm's cache is cleared with every startup:
```bash
npm run start
```

### Setting Up Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/?hl=en) and create a new project: 
   ![New Firebase project](/screenshots/1.firebase.png)

2. Assign a name to your project: 
   ![Project name](/screenshots/2.firebase.png)

3. Once set up, you should see a screen like this. If not, navigate to `settings/project settings/general`: 
   ![Project settings](/screenshots/3.firebase.png)

4. Copy these details and locate the `.env.example` file in the project. This file indicates how to structure your environment variables. Create a `.env` file and paste your Firebase project details there:
  ```env
    FIREBASE_APIKEY=
    FIREBASE_AUTHDOMAIN=
    FIREBASE_PROJECTID=
    FIREBASE_STORAGEBUCKET=
    FIREBASE_MESSAGINGSENDERID=
    FIREBASE_APPID=
    FIREBASE_MEASUREMENTID=
  ```
